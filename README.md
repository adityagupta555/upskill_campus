Project submission report:-QUIZ GAME USING-PYTHON Python programming will be used in the Quiz Game project to create a quiz game for consoles.
The game will ask players multiple-choice questions, and the responses will be assessed right away. After the game, the scores will be recorded and presented.
OBJECTIVES -> Develop an interactive quiz game using Python. Create a database of questions with multiple choice answers. ->
Compute and keep track of the players' scores. Show the outcome and provide feedback for each question. ->Allow players to take part in the game more than once.

USED TECHNOLOGIES A computer language used to create video games is called Python. Question and answer databases can be managed using SQLite.
Systems Design:- The following are the project's components for the quiz game: Game progression, question presentation, and user input processing are all under the control of the main programme logic. Database management is responsible for maintaining and retrieving questions from a SQLite database. Score tracking: Tracks the overall score and keeps track of each player's performance. User interface: Provides players with questions, choices, and comments. 
THE APPLICATION OF STEPS Create a SQLite database in Step 1 to store the queries and responses. Write Python code to connect to the database and get questions in step two. 
Step 3: Develop the sport's sound judgement to ask questions and solicit feedback from fans. 
Step 4: Determine and fine-tune the player's rating based only on their responses. 
Step 5: Instantly respond to each question with comments. Step 6: Present the most recent rating and give the option to play again.
CONCLUSION:- Python is used to construct a console-based quiz game in the Quiz Game project. It offers rapid feedback, calculates players' scores, and lets them respond to multiple-choice questions. By expanding the database of questions and improving the user interface, the game can be made bigger. This project advances Python database administration knowledge and programming skills. 
Users can enjoy playing a fun quiz game and hone their Python programming skills by putting this project into practise.
